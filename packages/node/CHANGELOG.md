# @commet/node

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 836b309: Convert to monorepo structure with independent packages

  **Breaking Changes:**

  - SDK package renamed from `commet` to `@commet/node`
  - CLI remains as `commet` but is now a separate package

  **Migration Guide:**

  SDK users need to update their imports:

  ```diff
  - import { Commet } from 'commet';
  + import { Commet } from '@commet/node';
  ```

  CLI users have no changes - all commands remain the same.

  **New Features:**

  - Independent versioning for SDK and CLI
  - Smaller SDK package (no CLI dependencies)
  - Turbo-powered parallel builds
  - Changesets for automated versioning and publishing
  - Biome for fast linting and formatting

  See MIGRATION.md for complete details.
