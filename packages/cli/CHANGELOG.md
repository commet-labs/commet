# commet

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 54590c9: Refactor CLI structure and improve developer experience

  **Breaking Changes:**

  - File structure changed from `.commet` and `.commet.d.ts` to `.commet/config.json` and `.commet/types.d.ts`
  - Users need to delete old files and run `commet link` and `commet pull` again

  **New Features:**

  - Automatic `tsconfig.json` update when running `commet pull` (adds `.commet/types.d.ts` to include array)
  - Automatic `.gitignore` update in both `commet link` and `commet pull` (adds `.commet/` directory)
  - Works without `tsconfig.json` or `.gitignore` - shows warnings with instructions instead of failing
  - Cleaner output messages without emojis
  - Uses `jsonc-parser` to preserve comments and formatting in `tsconfig.json`

  **Improvements:**

  - Cleaner directory structure with `.commet/` folder containing all generated files
  - `commet unlink` now removes entire `.commet/` directory
  - Better error messages that are simple and actionable
  - Non-blocking warnings when files can't be updated automatically

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- ba5f638: Fix TypeScript module augmentation for inquirer theme in generator utility

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- ccc529b: Implement automatic type inference via module augmentation. Types are now automatically applied after running `commet pull` without needing to pass generic type parameters.

  **Breaking change for @commet/node users**: If you were using explicit generic types like `commet.usage.events.create<CommetEventType>()`, you can now simply use `commet.usage.events.create()` and TypeScript will automatically infer the correct types.

  **CLI improvement**: The generated `.commet.d.ts` file is now simpler and only contains the module augmentation declaration, removing the exported `CommetEventType` and `CommetSeatType` types that are no longer needed.

- Updated dependencies [ccc529b]
  - @commet/node@0.5.0

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- af8c080: Improved CLI authentication flow and user experience

  **Breaking behavior change:**

  - Environment (sandbox/production) is now selected during `commet login` instead of `commet link`
  - The access token is tied to the selected environment, making it more secure and straightforward
  - `commet link` and `commet switch` now only prompt for organization selection

  **UI improvements:**

  - Migrated from `inquirer` to `@inquirer/prompts` for better theming support
  - Added custom Commet brand color (#A0DED4) with mint highlighting for selected options
  - Added graceful Ctrl+C handling with clean exit messages instead of stack traces
  - Improved visual feedback: only the currently selected option is highlighted in color

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- dfc4cca: Add environment selection during login to support isolated sandbox and production platforms

  - Login now prompts user to select between Sandbox (sandbox.commet.co) and Production (billing.commet.co)
  - Authentication tokens are now environment-specific
  - Updated URLs: sandbox uses sandbox.commet.co, production uses billing.commet.co
  - Link and switch commands now use the authenticated environment instead of hardcoded sandbox
  - Updated documentation to clarify that sandbox and production are completely isolated platforms

  **Breaking Change**: Users will need to re-authenticate after upgrading to select their environment.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 836b309: Convert to monorepo structure with independent packages

  **Breaking Changes:**

  - SDK package renamed from `commet` to `@commet/node`
  - CLI remains as `commet` but is now a separate package

  **Migration Guide:**

  SDK users need to update their imports:

  ```diff
  - import { Commet } from 'commet';
  + import { Commet } from '@commet/node';
  ```

  CLI users have no changes - all commands remain the same.

  **New Features:**

  - Independent versioning for SDK and CLI
  - Smaller SDK package (no CLI dependencies)
  - Turbo-powered parallel builds
  - Changesets for automated versioning and publishing
  - Biome for fast linting and formatting

  See MIGRATION.md for complete details.
