## Files

| File | Created by | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| `~/.commet/auth.json` | `commet login` | Global auth credentials |
| `.commet` | `commet link` | Project organization settings |
| `.commet/types.d.ts` | `commet pull` | Generated TypeScript types |

## Environments

Two isolated environments:

- **Sandbox** (`sandbox.commet.co`) - Development
- **Production** (`commet.co`) - Live billing

To switch:

```bash
commet logout
commet login  # Select different environment
commet link
```

## Git

Commit `.commet/types.d.ts` for consistent types across the team. The `.commet/` folder itself is auto-added to `.gitignore` by `commet pull`.
