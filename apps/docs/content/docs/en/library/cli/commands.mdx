## Type Generation

### `commet pull`

Generate TypeScript types in `.commet/types.d.ts`.

```bash
commet pull
```

Creates:
- `.commet/` directory
- `.commet/types.d.ts` with event types, seat types, plans, and features
- Updates `tsconfig.json` to include the types
- Updates `.gitignore` to ignore `.commet/`

**Generated file:**
```typescript
// .commet/types.d.ts
/**
 * Event types available in your organization:
 * - "api_call": API Calls - Track API usage
 * - "email_sent": Emails Sent - Email delivery events
 * 
 * Seat types available in your organization:
 * - "admin": Administrator - Full access (Free)
 * - "user": Standard User - Regular access
 * 
 * Plans available in your organization:
 * - "starter": Starter - For individuals
 * - "pro": Pro - For teams
 * 
 * Features available in your organization:
 * - "api_calls": API Calls (metered)
 * - "team_members": Team Members (seats)
 */
declare module '@commet/node' {
  interface CommetGeneratedTypes {
    eventType: "api_call" | "email_sent";
    seatType: "admin" | "user";
    planCode: "starter" | "pro";
    featureCode: "api_calls" | "team_members";
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { Commet } from '@commet/node'

const commet = new Commet({ apiKey: '...' })

// Autocomplete for event types
await commet.usage.track({
  externalId: 'user_123',
  eventType: 'api_call', // ✓ autocomplete
})

// Autocomplete for seat types

  externalId: 'user_123',
  seatType: 'admin', // ✓ autocomplete
  count: 5
})

// Autocomplete for plan codes
await commet.subscriptions.create({
  externalId: 'user_123',
  planCode: 'pro', // ✓ autocomplete
