title: Customer Context
description: Simplified API scoped to a single customer
---

`commet.customer()` creates a scoped context where you don't pass `externalId` on every call.

```typescript
const customer = commet.customer('user_123')

await customer.usage.track('api_call')
await customer.seats.add('editor')
await customer.features.check('custom_branding')
await customer.subscription.get()
await customer.portal.getUrl()
```
