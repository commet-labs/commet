description: Manage subscriptions with the plan-first model

Each customer can only have one active subscription at a time.

## Create

Returns a `checkoutUrl` - redirect user there to complete payment.

```typescript
const subscription = await commet.subscriptions.create({
  externalId: 'user_123',
  planCode: 'pro',
})

redirect(subscription.data.checkoutUrl)
```

## Get

Returns full subscription details including feature usage summary.

```typescript
const sub = await commet.subscriptions.get({ externalId: 'user_123' })

if (sub.data?.status === 'active') {
  // User has paid
}
```

## Change Plan

Proration is automatic - credits unused time and charges for new plan.

```typescript
await commet.subscriptions.changePlan('sub_xxx', { planCode: 'enterprise' })
```

## Cancel

Cancels at end of current period by default.

```typescript
await commet.subscriptions.cancel('sub_xxx')
```
