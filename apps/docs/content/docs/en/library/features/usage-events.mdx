title: Usage Events
description: Track usage for billing
---

Usage is aggregated and billed at end of period.

## Track

```typescript
await commet.usage.track({
  externalId: 'user_123',
  eventType: 'api_call',
})
```

## Batch

More efficient for high-volume tracking.

```typescript
await commet.usage.trackBatch({
  events: [
    { externalId: 'user_123', eventType: 'api_call' },
    { externalId: 'user_456', eventType: 'api_call' },
  ]
})
```
