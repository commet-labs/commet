# Features

Features define what customers can access and use within a Plan. They specify capabilities, usage limits, seat allocations, and pricing for overages. When you add features to a Plan, all customers assigned to that plan receive those features.

<Callout type="success">
The Platform section is designed for go-to-market, finance, and operations teams. If you need implementation details, go to the [Developer Library](/docs/library/quickstart).
</Callout>

## Quick start example

Here's how features work in a typical SaaS plan:

1. **Define features**: Create features for capabilities like API calls, storage, or seats
2. **Add to plans**: Configure features in your Plans with included amounts and limits
3. **Automatic access**: When a customer is assigned a plan, they automatically get all plan features
4. **Track usage**: Monitor feature consumption in real-time through subscriptions

Features make plans powerful by combining multiple capabilities into a single subscription package.

## Why features matter

- **Define capabilities**: Specify exactly what customers can access in each plan
- **Set limits**: Control usage with included amounts and overage pricing
- **Track consumption**: Monitor how customers use each feature
- **Flexible pricing**: Combine different feature types (boolean, metered, seats) in one plan
- **Automatic enforcement**: Features are automatically tracked and billed based on usage

## Feature types

Plans support three types of features, each serving different business needs:

<Tabs items={['Boolean', 'Metered', 'Seats']}>
<Tab value="Boolean">

Boolean features are simple on/off capabilities. A customer either has access or they don't.

| Aspect | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **How it works** | On/off access to a capability |
| **Examples** | • Single Sign-On (SSO) enabled<br />• Custom branding<br />• White-label options<br />• Priority support access<br />• Advanced analytics dashboard |
| **Configuration** | • **Enabled**: Customer has access<br />• **Disabled**: Customer does not have access |
| **Usage tracking** | No usage amounts or overage pricing—simply enabled or disabled based on the plan |

</Tab>
<Tab value="Metered">

Metered features track consumption and can include included amounts, overage pricing, or unlimited usage.

| Aspect | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **How it works** | Usage-based limits with optional overage pricing |
| **Examples** | • API calls: 10,000 included, then $0.01 per call<br />• Storage: 100 GB included, then $0.10 per GB<br />• Compute hours: 50 hours included, then $2.00 per hour<br />• Email sends: 50,000 included, then $0.001 per email |
| **Configuration options** | • **Included amount**: Free units included in the plan price<br />• **Unlimited**: No limits (use for premium plans)<br />• **Overage enabled**: Allow usage beyond included amount<br />• **Overage unit price**: Price per unit for overage usage |

<Callout type="info">
For detailed information about managing events, see the [Events Management documentation](../usage-metrics/events).
</Callout>

</Tab>
<Tab value="Seats">

Seat features allocate per-user licenses. Customers pay for each user who has access.

| Aspect | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **How it works** | Per-user licenses with included seats and optional overage |
| **Examples** | • Editor seats: 5 included, then $10 per additional seat<br />• Admin seats: 2 included, then $25 per additional seat<br />• Team member seats: 10 included, then $5 per additional seat |
| **Configuration options** | • **Included seats**: Number of seats included in the plan price<br />• **Unlimited**: No seat limits (use for enterprise plans)<br />• **Overage enabled**: Allow additional seats beyond included<br />• **Seat price**: Price per additional seat per billing period |

<Callout type="info">
For detailed information about managing seats, see the [Seat Management documentation](../seats/seats-overview).

## How to add features to a plan

<Steps>
<Step>

### Navigate to plan configuration

When creating or editing a Plan, go to the **Features** section.

</Step>
<Step>

### Add a feature

Click **Add Feature** and select the feature you want to include. Features are created separately and can be reused across multiple plans.

If the feature doesn't exist yet, you'll need to create it first.

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure feature settings

Configure how the feature works in this specific plan:

**For Boolean features:**
- Enable or disable the feature

**For Metered features:**
- Set included amount (e.g., 10,000 API calls)
- Choose unlimited or set limits
- Enable overage and set unit price if applicable

**For Seat features:**
- Set included seat count (e.g., 5 editor seats)
- Choose unlimited or set limits
- Enable overage and set seat price if applicable

</Step>
<Step>

### Save and repeat

Save the feature configuration and add additional features as needed. A single plan can include multiple features of different types.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Feature configuration examples

<Tabs items={['Starter Plan','Pro Plan', 'Enterprise Plan']}>
<Tab value="Starter Plan">

A Starter Plan with basic features:

| Feature Type | Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Boolean** | SSO enabled ✗ |
| **Metered** | API calls - 1,000 included, no overage (hard limit) |
| **Metered** | Storage - 10 GB included, no overage (hard limit) |
| **Seats** | Editor seats - 1 included, $15 per additional seat |

</Tab>

<Tab value="Pro Plan">

| Feature Type | Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| **Boolean** | SSO enabled ✓ |
| **Boolean** | Custom branding ✓ |
| **Metered** | API calls - 10,000 included, $0.01 per call overage |
| **Metered** | Storage - 100 GB included, $0.10 per GB overage |

| **Metered** | API calls - Unlimited |
| **Metered** | Storage - Unlimited |
| **Seats** | Editor seats - Unlimited |

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Feature usage tracking

Once a plan with features is assigned to a customer and the subscription is active, you can track feature usage:

### Viewing feature usage

From the subscription details page, you can see:

- **Current usage**: Real-time consumption for metered features
- **Included limits**: What's included in the plan
- **Overage**: Usage beyond included amounts
- **Seat counts**: Current seat allocation per seat type
- **Feature status**: Enabled/disabled status for boolean features

### Usage monitoring

- **Real-time tracking**: Usage is tracked as customers consume features
- **Billing period reset**: Usage resets at the start of each billing cycle
- **Overage alerts**: Monitor when customers approach or exceed limits
- **Historical data**: View usage trends over time

<Callout type="info">
For detailed information about tracking usage events, see the [Usage Metrics documentation](../usage-metrics/events).
</Callout>

## Feature access control: coming soon

We're working on SDK and API methods to programmatically control and check feature access in your application:

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Check feature access** | Query if a customer has access to a specific feature (gate features in your app, verify plan includes feature) |
| **Query usage and limits** | Check current usage, remaining capacity, seat counts, and overage status for metered features |
| **Limit exceedance webhooks** | Receive real-time notifications when customers exceed limits (overage alerts, threshold warnings, seat capacity) |

Use cases: Feature gating, usage dashboards, progress bars, automated enforcement, and customer notifications.

<Callout type="info">
These access control methods will be available in an upcoming release. For now, you can view feature access and usage through the platform interface.
</Callout>


## Common errors to avoid

- **Setting limits too low**: Include enough free usage to provide value without overages
- **Unclear feature names**: Use customer-friendly names, not internal codes
- **Forgetting overage pricing**: If you allow overages, make sure pricing is configured
- **Too many features**: Start with essential features and add more based on customer feedback
- **Not tracking usage**: Ensure metered features are properly configured for tracking

## Editing features in plans

You can modify feature configurations in a plan at any time:

- **Change included amounts**: Update free usage limits
- **Modify overage pricing**: Adjust prices for overage usage
- **Add or remove features**: Include new features or remove unused ones
- **Toggle boolean features**: Enable or disable capabilities

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Changes to features in a plan only affect new subscriptions. Existing subscriptions keep their original feature configuration. If you need to update existing customers, you'll need to change their plan assignment.
