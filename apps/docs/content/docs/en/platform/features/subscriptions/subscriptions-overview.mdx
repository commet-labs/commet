# Subscription Management

Subscriptions are the heart of Commet. They define how and how much to charge your customers on a recurring basis, connecting products, customers, and agreements in an automated billing flow.

<Callout type="success">
The Platform section is designed for go-to-market, finance, and operations teams. If you need implementation details, go to the [Developer Library](/docs/library/quickstart).
</Callout>

## Quick start example

Here's how a typical SaaS company creates and manages subscriptions:

1. **Create a customer**: Register customer information with their billing email
2. **Select products**: Choose products and price variants from the catalog
3. **Start subscription**: Generate the checkout and send the payment link to the customer
4. **Automatic billing**: Once active, Commet automatically generates recurring invoices

The billing engine handles the entire cycle: creation → checkout → activation → recurring billing.

## Why subscriptions matter

- **Automated recurring billing**: Once active, subscriptions automatically generate invoices each period without manual intervention
- **Complete lifecycle control**: Manage states, start dates, cancellations, and renewals from a single place
- **Full visibility**: Access invoice history, payments, and customer details in real time
- **Operational flexibility**: Create subscriptions as drafts for review, schedule future dates, or activate immediately

## Subscription lifecycle

Subscriptions go through different states during their lifetime:

| State | Description | When it occurs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Draft` | Subscription created but not started | When you create a subscription for review before sending to the customer |
| `Pending payment` | Customer received the checkout but hasn't completed payment | Immediately after starting the subscription |
| `Canceled` (Checkout expired) | Customer didn't complete payment within 24 hours | Automatically after 24 hours without payment |
| `Active` | Customer completed payment and subscription is billing | After the first successful payment |

## How to create a subscription

### Step 1: Select or create customer

Navigate to **Subscriptions** in the platform and click **Create Subscription**.

If the customer already exists in your system, search for them by name or email. If it's a new customer, you can create them directly from the subscription creation flow.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: The customer's email is used as the delivery address for the payment link and cannot be modified in the checkout. Make sure to use the correct email from the start.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Add products

Select the products you want to include in the subscription:

- **Catalog products**: Choose from products you've previously created
- **Price variants**: Select the specific variant for this customer (list price or custom variant)
- **Custom adjustments**: If the customer requires discounts or special conditions, you can edit the product conditions and generate new variants on the spot

<Callout type="info">
**Automatic variants**: If you apply discounts or modify prices during creation, Commet automatically generates a price variant specific to this customer.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Start subscription

When the subscription is ready, click **Start**. The subscription will be created in "Pending payment" status and a checkout link will be automatically generated that you can send to the customer.

## Subscription details

Each subscription includes complete information to manage the billing cycle:

### Checkout link

- **View current link**: Access the payment link generated for the customer
- **Regenerate link**: If the checkout expired or you need a new link, you can regenerate it (only available if the subscription is not active)
- **Share with customer**: Copy the link to send via email or integrate it into your onboarding flow

### Generated invoices

- **Complete history**: View all invoices generated for this subscription
- **Automatic billing**: Each billing period automatically generates a new invoice
- **Payment details**: Review payment status, due dates, and payment methods

### Customer information

- **Contact data**: Quickly access the associated customer information
- **Subscription history**: View all active and historical subscriptions for the customer
- **Billing configuration**: Review currency, payment terms, and billing address

## Best practices

- **Verify customer email**: Confirm the email before creating the customer, as it cannot be modified in the checkout
- **Leverage price variants**: Use variants for permanent customer conditions instead of applying temporary discounts
- **Monitor pending states**: Regularly review subscriptions in "Pending payment" for active follow-up
- **Regenerate expired checkouts**: If a checkout expired, regenerate the link instead of creating a new subscription

## Common errors to avoid

- **Incorrect customer email**: Verify the email before creating the customer, as it's used for the checkout and cannot be changed
- **Creating multiple subscriptions for the same customer**: If a checkout expired, regenerate the link instead of creating a new subscription
- **Forgetting to activate drafts**: Draft subscriptions don't generate invoices until manually activated
- **Not reviewing applied variants**: Confirm that the applied price variants are correct before starting the subscription

## SDK integration

All the steps described above can be performed programmatically through our SDK. This is the recommended way to integrate Commet directly into your application.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete subscription flow when integrating Commet into your application. Note that this diagram assumes you already have customers and products created in your system. It shows the interaction between your frontend, backend, and Commet's services: starting from when a user initiates a subscription, through the checkout process where they enter their payment method, to the final activation where Commet sends a webhook to your backend to enable user features.

<Callout type="info">
**For in-app integrations**: If you're building an integration within your application, use the SDK instead of the platform interface. This allows you to completely automate the subscription flow and keep everything synchronized with your system.
</Callout>

### Advantages of using the SDK

- **Complete automation**: Create and manage subscriptions directly from your code without manual intervention
- **Real-time synchronization**: Keep your data synchronized with Commet automatically
- **Improved user experience**: Integrate the checkout directly into your application without redirecting to external pages
- **Scalability**: Manage thousands of subscriptions programmatically without interface limitations

### Typical SDK flow

1. **Create customer**: Use `commet.customers.create()` when a user registers in your application
2. **Create subscription**: Call `commet.subscriptions.create()` when the user selects a plan
3. **Get checkout**: Access the checkout link from the subscription response
4. **Manage states**: Monitor state changes through webhooks or periodic queries
