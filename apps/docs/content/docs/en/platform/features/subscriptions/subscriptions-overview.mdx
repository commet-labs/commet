# Subscription Management

Subscriptions are automatically created when you assign a Plan to a Customer. They connect plans, customers, and billing cycles in an automated workflow that handles recurring billing, feature access, and usage tracking.

<Callout type="success">
The Platform section is designed for go-to-market, finance, and operations teams. If you need implementation details, go to the [Developer Library](/docs/library/quickstart).
</Callout>

## Quick start example

Here's how subscriptions work with Commet's plan-first model:

1. **Create Plans**: Define your pricing tiers (Starter, Pro, Enterprise) with features and prices
2. **Assign Plan to Customer**: Select a customer and assign a plan—the subscription is created automatically
3. **Automatic billing**: Once active, Commet automatically generates recurring invoices each billing period
4. **Manage lifecycle**: Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions as customer needs change

The billing engine handles the entire cycle: Plan assignment → Subscription creation → Checkout → Activation → Recurring billing.

## Why subscriptions matter

- **Automated recurring billing**: Once active, subscriptions automatically generate invoices each period without manual intervention
- **Complete lifecycle control**: Manage states, cancellations, and renewals from a single place
- **Full visibility**: Access invoice history, payments, and customer details in real time
- **Plan-based simplicity**: Subscriptions inherit all configuration from plans, making management easier
- **Automatic creation**: No manual subscription setup needed—just assign a plan to a customer

## Plan-first subscription model

In Commet, subscriptions are not created manually from the platform interface. Instead, they are automatically created when you assign a Plan to a Customer.

### How it works

<Steps>
<Step>

**Create your Plans** with all pricing, features, and billing intervals configured

</Step>
<Step>

**Assign a Plan to a Customer** — this automatically creates a Subscription

</Step>
<Step>

**The Subscription starts** in the appropriate status based on payment and trial settings

</Step>
</Steps>

This plan-first approach ensures:
- **Consistency**: All customers on the same plan get the same configuration
- **Simplicity**: No need to manually configure each subscription
- **Scalability**: Easily manage hundreds or thousands of subscriptions
- **Updates**: Modify plans and future assignments use the updated configuration

<Callout type="info">
Learn more about creating and managing Plans in the [Plans documentation](../plans-and-features/plans).
</Callout>

## How subscriptions are created

<Steps>
<Step>

### Select or create customer

Navigate to **Customers** in the platform and select the customer you want to assign a plan to. If the customer doesn't exist yet, you can create them directly from the customer management section.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: The customer's email is used as the delivery address for the payment link and cannot be modified in the checkout. Make sure to use the correct email from the start.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Assign a plan

From the customer detail page, click **Assign Plan** or **Change Plan**. You'll see all available plans:

- **Public plans**: Plans visible on your pricing page
- **Private plans**: Internal plans not shown publicly (useful for enterprise deals)

Select the plan you want to assign. You can also choose:
- **Billing interval**: Monthly, quarterly, or yearly (if the plan supports multiple intervals)
- **Initial seats**: For plans with seat-based features, set the starting seat count
- **Skip trial**: Optionally skip the trial period if the plan has one configured

</Step>
<Step>

### Subscription is created automatically

When you confirm the plan assignment, Commet automatically:
- Creates a Subscription for the customer
- Links the subscription to the selected plan
- Sets the billing interval and initial configuration
- Generates a checkout link if payment is required

The subscription status depends on the plan configuration:
- **Trialing**: If the plan has trial days configured
- **Pending payment**: If payment is required to activate
- **Active**: If no payment or trial is needed

</Step>
</Steps>

## Subscription lifecycle

Subscriptions go through different states during their lifetime:

| State | Description | When it occurs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Draft` | Subscription created but not activated | When created programmatically for review |
| `Trialing` | Customer in free trial period | When plan has trial days and trial hasn't ended |
| `Pending payment` | Customer received checkout but hasn't paid | Immediately after plan assignment if payment required |
| `Active` | Subscription is billing normally | After trial ends or payment is completed |
| `Paused` | Temporarily paused (no billing) | When manually paused by operations team |
| `Past due` | Payment failed, in grace period | When payment method fails |
| `Canceled` | Canceled, no longer billing | When customer cancels or subscription ends |
| `Expired` | Reached end date | When subscription reaches scheduled end |

## Subscription details

Each subscription includes complete information to manage the billing cycle:

### Current plan information

- **Plan name**: See which plan the customer is subscribed to
- **Billing interval**: Monthly, quarterly, or yearly
- **Plan features**: View all features included in the plan
- **Trial status**: Check if subscription is in trial period

### Billing information

- **Current period**: Start and end dates of the current billing cycle
- **Days remaining**: How many days until the next invoice
- **Next invoice date**: When the next recurring invoice will be generated
- **Amount**: Current plan price for the selected billing interval

### Feature usage

For plans with metered or seat-based features:

- **Current usage**: Track consumption in real-time
- **Included limits**: See what's included in the plan
- **Overage**: Monitor usage beyond included amounts
- **Seat counts**: Current seat allocation per seat type

<Callout type="info">
Learn more about how features work in plans in the [Features documentation](../plans-and-features/features).
</Callout>

### Checkout link

- **View current link**: Access the payment link generated for the customer
- **Regenerate link**: If the checkout expired or you need a new link, you can regenerate it (only available if the subscription is not active)
- **Delivery to customer**: The checkout link is sent automatically to the customer's email. If you're using the SDK, you can also integrate the link directly into your onboarding flow.

### Generated invoices

- **Complete history**: View all invoices generated for this subscription
- **Automatic billing**: Each billing period automatically generates a new invoice
- **Payment details**: Review payment status, due dates, and payment methods

### Customer information

- **Contact data**: Quickly access the associated customer information
- **Subscription history**: View all active and historical subscriptions for the customer
- **Billing configuration**: Review currency, payment terms, and billing address

## Managing subscriptions

### Change plan (upgrade/downgrade)

<Steps>
<Step>

Navigate to the customer detail page

</Step>
<Step>

Click **Change Plan** on the active subscription

</Step>
<Step>

Select the new plan

</Step>
<Step>

Commet automatically handles proration:
- Credits unused time from the current plan
- Charges for the new plan going forward
- Adjusts the billing cycle accordingly

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
**Automatic proration**: Commet calculates credits and charges automatically when changing plans. The customer is charged or credited based on the time remaining in the billing period.
</Callout>

### Cancel subscription

<Steps>
<Step>

Navigate to the customer detail page

</Step>
<Step>

Click **Cancel Subscription** on the active subscription

</Step>
<Step>

Optionally provide a cancellation reason

</Step>
<Step>

Choose when cancellation takes effect:
- **Immediately**: Stops billing right away
- **End of period**: Continues billing until current period ends

</Step>
</Steps>

Canceled subscriptions remain visible for historical tracking but no longer generate invoices.

### Regenerate checkout link

If a customer hasn't completed payment and the checkout link expired:

<Steps>
<Step>

Navigate to the subscription details

</Step>
<Step>

Click **Regenerate Checkout Link**

</Step>
<Step>

Send the new link to the customer

</Step>
</Steps>

This is more efficient than reassigning the plan or creating a new subscription.


## SDK integration

All the steps described above can be performed programmatically through our SDK. This is the recommended way to integrate Commet directly into your application.

![Subscription lifecycle sequence diagram](/images/platform/subs-sequence-diagram.png)

<Callout type="info">
**For in-app integrations**: If you're building an integration within your application, use the SDK instead of the platform interface. This allows you to completely automate the subscription flow and keep everything synchronized with your system.
</Callout>

### Advantages of using the SDK

- **Complete automation**: Assign plans and manage subscriptions directly from your code without manual intervention
- **Real-time synchronization**: Keep your data synchronized with Commet automatically
- **Improved user experience**: Integrate the checkout directly into your application without redirecting to external pages
- **Scalability**: Manage thousands of subscriptions programmatically without interface limitations

### Typical SDK flow

<Steps>
<Step>

**List available plans**: Use `commet.plans.list()` to show customers available options

</Step>
<Step>

**Assign plan**: Call `commet.subscriptions.create()` with a `planCode` to create the subscription automatically

</Step>
<Step>

**Get checkout**: Access the checkout link from the subscription response

</Step>
<Step>

**Monitor usage**: Track feature usage and seat counts through the subscription details

</Step>
<Step>

**Manage changes**: Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel through the SDK

</Step>
</Steps>
