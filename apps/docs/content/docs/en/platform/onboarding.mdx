In this guide you'll find the steps to follow if it's your first time accessing Commet and you want to test its core functionalities.


<Steps>
<Step>

### 1. Create an account

To begin, you have two options:

- **Sandbox:** Visit [https://sandbox.commet.co/login](https://sandbox.commet.co/login) to create a test account. This is ideal for exploring functionality and simulating real scenarios without risk.
- **Production:** If you'd like to start directly in production, go to [https://commet.co/login](https://commet.co/login).

In both cases, if it's your first time signing in, you'll be asked to complete some basic company information.

</Step>

<Step>

### 2. Create your products

From the products tab, create your products, whether they're one-time, recurring, fixed, or tied to some metric created previously.

<Callout type="info">
Maybe your products are consumption-based or seat-based. You can create these metrics right there. Later, you'll be able to send events via API to test with real data.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### 3. Create a subscription

A subscription is where all the conditions agreed upon with your customer come together. Each one can have different phases and will determine What and How we will charge our customers.

<Callout type="info">
Commet is also designed to be the source of truth for your customers. Therefore, if you don't have customers created, you'll need to create one at that moment to associate that subscription.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### 4. Simulation

At this stage, you'll be able to simulate your subscription to see exactly how it would look. When the billing date set in the subscription arrives, Commet will send the invoice with the usage detail and charge the customer.

<Callout type="warning">
In sandbox you won't be able to create a real subscription.
</Callout>

</Step>

### 5. Next steps

At this point, you have two options:

**Option A: Get a production account**
[Book a slot with our team](https://cal.com/guido-irigoyen/onboarding-meeting) so we can help you find the best plan for you. Our team will handle the migration of all your data so you can start operating with Commet in production as soon as possible.

**Option B: Test with real data in Sandbox**
Go to the API Keys section and start integrating the SDK to try Commet sandbox with real data. Check out our [Quick Start guide](/library/quickstart) to get up and running in under 5 minutes. This allows you to test the full functionality using your own data before moving to production.
