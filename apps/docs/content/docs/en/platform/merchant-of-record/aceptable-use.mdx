# Acceptable Use Policy

Commet serves as your Merchant of Record, meaning we operate as the official reseller of your digital products and services. Our platform is designed specifically for digital offerings and does not accommodate physical items or services that depend on human delivery or manual fulfillment.

Beyond the digital-only constraint, we maintain strict standards: we cannot process transactions for anything unlawful, dangerous, misleading, or that fails to meet our quality and trustworthiness criteria.

**Have questions about your specific use case?** [Contact our support team](mailto:help@commet.co) before starting your integration. We can review your situation and offer personalized guidance.
</Callout>

## Restricted Categories

Certain business types need extra scrutiny and must demonstrate elevated standards in quality, reliability, and regulatory compliance:

* **eBooks**: Need to deliver real value and meet our quality benchmarks
* **Ticket sales**: Must comply with regional regulations and legal requirements
* **Pre-orders & paid waitlists**: Present higher risk for Merchant of Record operations; we may consider exceptions for established developers with proven delivery records
* **Marketing services**: Should emphasize authentic, sustainable value over questionable shortcuts or bulk unsolicited communications
* **Directories & boards**: Frequently feature paid positioning (essentially advertising) that may lack appropriate disclosure and compliance measures

## What You Can Sell

Commet enables you to monetize these digital product and service categories:

* **Premium access**: Subscription-based content, gated digital experiences, private GitHub repositories, Discord servers, and online educational courses
* **Digital products**: Code repositories, templates, eBooks, PDFs, icons, fonts, design resources, photos, videos, audio files, and similar digital assets
* **Software & SaaS**: Mobile applications, desktop software, web applications, and software-as-a-service offerings

### Core Requirements

For your product or service to be eligible, it needs to meet these criteria:

1. **Compliant**: Must be lawful, ethical, transparent, and consistent with payment provider regulations
2. **High quality**: Should be something you'd confidently present publicly—avoid anything that undermines trust or quality expectations
3. **Digitally fulfillable**: Must be deliverable either automatically through Commet (access links, file downloads, license keys, invitations) or instantly available via your service using our APIs following purchase
